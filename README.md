This Java program takes two integer inputs from the user and processes them using a simple arithmetic condition. It multiplies the second input by 10, adds the result to the first input, and checks if the final sum is at least 100. If the condition is met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". The program utilizes the Scanner class for input handling and follows a straightforward conditional structure for decision-making.
